# PyCalculator using Kivy

A little fun project using python 3 and the Kivy framework to make a standard calculator.

### *OLD WITH NO CODE UPDATE SINCE April 2018!One of my first python projects... #embarrassing*

Usage:

    setup venv: python3 -m venv <venv name>
    enter venv: ./venvname/Scripts/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python3 PyCalculator.py

Feel free to do code review and get back to me if you see bad style, bad code or if you have any tips and tricks for me. Learning everyday and want to be the best i can be.
Positive feedback is also always appreciated ofcourse.

Happy coding

Chris
